		<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, what can i say is that it was a really wonderful moments and memories by joining the club in my diploma time. The club that i joined named Prime Mover UiTM club. It is such a great club, i can say! </p>

		<p>
			<div align="center"><img src="moments1.gif" style="width: 300px;" alt="My great memories" class="center"></div>
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><b>"We have to enjoy every moments <3"</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, by joing this club, there are many things that I can learn, no matter whether it is new or not. When joining the club, we are given the opportunity to participate in the programs held. Before covid 19 hit, we had held various programs in high schools regardless of state. We have held "tours" in many schools in Malaysia. We can also had the chance to join severals workshops that are very useful to use the knowledge in the future. I have joined  this Prime Mover club from being just an active member, then turned into a club secretariat. In fact, I was also got promoted to be a club's highest councilor, namely as a secretary general of Prime Mover UiTM. What is interesting and inspiring is that now I have become a former of the positions thatI have held before. I did not expect that time has passes so fast, as I have been with Prime Mover club for over two years. I also want to finish my diploma because now I am in my last semester which is semester five. </p>
